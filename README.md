# Insertion-Sort-Algorithm

The wrost case time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2).

Insertion Sort pseudocode:

Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 1 into the sorted subarray in index 0.

Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 2 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through 1.

Call insert to insert the element that starts at index 3 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through 2.
…

Finally, call insert to insert the element that starts at index n-1n−1 into the sorted subarray in indices 0 through n−2.
